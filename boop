<h2>Slightly overwhelmed?</h2>

<h4>February 17, 2017</h4>

<p>Howdy! The last time I was just starting to get a grip on Flexbox. Now I think I know just enough of it to be useful, and I’ve used it to finish my portfolio page project on freeCodeCamp. You can see the end result <a href="https://codepen.io/ellenkorbes/full/vgremq/">here</a> (and just for kicks <a href="http://codepen.io/ellenkorbes/full/vgMgde/">here</a>’s the project I did before that).</p>

<p>It works alright, I guess, but there’s still too much of it that’s a mystery to me. I needed to ask for help to get the burger menu working—the one that appears on small screens and hides the nav menu—and, frankly, I have no idea how the things I was told to do ended up producing the results I got.</p>

<p>I really feel I need to pour more time into this, and keep at it until I master it. Unknowns are unsettling… But as you’ll read later on in this post, time is against me.</p>

<p>For now, moving on with the freeCodeCamp curricula.</p>

<p>I have four projects to complete next. They are in the <em>Intermediate Front End Development Projects</em> section, which comes right after <em>JSON APIs and Ajax</em> and <em>Basic Algorithm Scripting</em>. Should be fun. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe">Build a Random Quote Machine</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV">Show the Local Weather</a></li>
<li><a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga">Build a Wikipedia Viewer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo">Use the Twitch.tv JSON API</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can click each of them to see what the end result should look like. Again, sounds like a fun time.</p>

        <p>There are two more things on my plate as well:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>One is to get this website to run on Jekyll. Right now it’s a simple html sheet, which we all know doesn’t scale. </li>
    
    <li>And two is, I’ve volunteer to translate freeCodeCamp into Portuguese. The translation part should be fine, but the problem is that to do that I need to be somewhat proficient with Git, which right now I’m not. Gotta clone the repo onto my machine and so on. More reading.</li>
        </ul>

<p>Now, none of the projects sounds too complicated, and neither is getting Jekyll up and running or the translation thingy, but as someone who works full time and has a family and does the dishes and etc., finding the time is a bit difficult . It was frustrating this week that it took me so long learn Flexbox... it’s such a simple thing, but again, time. Time is my nemesis.</p>

<p>On top of that, the hell-on-Earth temperatures here in Brazil don’t help either. I wonder how many days in a row I can spend working under the mall’s A/C before they kick me out.</p>
