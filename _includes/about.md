# About

Hi, I'm L! I do developer relations at <a href="https://tilt.dev/">Tilt</a>.

I love <a href="{{ "/#journal" | relative_url }}">writing</a> and <a href="{{ "/#talks" | relative_url }}">speaking</a>, and sometimes I dabble on <a href="http://deffectivego.com/">YouTube</a> as well. I've published <a href="https://greatercommons.com/learn/golang-ptbr">Go course in Portuguese,</a> I'm a <a href="https://google-developers.appspot.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-ellen_k_C3_B6rbes">Google Developer Expert for Go</a>, and a CNCF ambassador.

I'm deeply involved with open source, more specifically Go and Kubernetes. I got my start in the Kubernetes world by working as an intern developer on SIG-CLI, thanks to [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/).

Currently I'm passionate about making multi-container systems easier and more accessible to develop in.

I'm non-binary and use they/them/their pronouns.
