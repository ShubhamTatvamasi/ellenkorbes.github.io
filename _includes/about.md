# About

Hi. I’m Ellen Körbes. I'm a software developer based in Brazil.

I'm currently working to produce the best golang online courses to ever be made available in the Portuguese language.

Sometimes people refer to me as "the girl who made the kubicorn website." It's cute, [check it out](http://kubicorn.io/).

My go-to coding soundtrack is [TimeCop1983](https://timecop1983.bandcamp.com/).

And in the past I’ve played classical violin for a living, wrote *way* too much dystopian fiction, and ran a restaurant.
