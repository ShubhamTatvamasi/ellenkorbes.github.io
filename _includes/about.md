# About

Hi. I’m Ellen Körbes. I'm a full-stack web developer based in Brazil.

My focus is Go and JavaScript, and right now I'm secretly working on my first big, bad-ass, nuclear-grade app.

In the past I’ve played classical violin for a living, wrote *way* too much dystopian fiction, and ran a restaurant.

Yes I was born in Brazil, and learned English all by myself, and I've never set foot in an English-speaking country. (Oh, and I translate patent applications on the side!)

My go-to coding soundtrack is [TimeCop1983](https://timecop1983.bandcamp.com/).
