# About

Hi. I’m Ellen Körbes. I'm a software developer based in Brazil.

I'm currently working as an intern software developer on the Kubernetes SIG-CLI group, more specifically messing around with `kubectl create` functionality. This internship was made possible thanks to [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) and [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).

And also I'm currently producing a Portuguese-language version of the most watched Golang course ever, together with [Todd McLeod](https://twitter.com/Todd_McLeod) and [Greater Commons](https://greatercommons.com/).

I really enjoy speaking in public. My first talk ever is up on my YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxD5EE0H7qOhRr0tIVsOZPQ) right now; more to be added soon.

Sometimes people refer to me as "the girl who made the kubicorn website." It's cute, [check it out](http://kubicorn.io/).

My go-to coding soundtrack is [TimeCop1983](https://timecop1983.bandcamp.com/).

And in the past I’ve played classical violin for a living, wrote *way* too much dystopian fiction, and ran a restaurant.
