# About

Hi. I’m Ellen Körbes. I'm a software developer based in Brazil.

I'm currently switching tracks, from front-end & JavaScript into back-end & golang. Go containers!

In the past I’ve played classical violin for a living, wrote *way* too much dystopian fiction, and ran a restaurant.

Oh, and yes, I was born in Brazil, and learned English all by myself without ever setting foot in an English-speaking country. (And nowadays I translate patent applications on the side! Yay me!)

My go-to coding soundtrack is [TimeCop1983](https://timecop1983.bandcamp.com/).
