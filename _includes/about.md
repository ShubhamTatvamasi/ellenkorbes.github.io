# About

Hi, I'm L! I do DevRel at <a href="https://tilt.dev/">Tilt</a>.

You probably know me from <a href="{{ "/#talks" | relative_url }}">talks and workshops</a>. I'm a <a href="https://google-developers.appspot.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-ellen_k_C3_B6rbes">Google Developer Expert for Go</a>, and a CNCF ambassador.

I'm very much involved with open source, more specifically Go and Kubernetes. I got my start in the Kubernetes world by working as an intern developer on SIG-CLI, thanks to [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/).

I'm passionate about making multi-service systems easier and more accessible to develop in.

I'm non-binary and use they/them/their pronouns.
