# Hire me

We all have people we can count on no matter the what. They're solid. Unshakeable. Come hell or high water, they're always the person you expect them to be.

I'm not that kind of person.

Others, they are never the same from one day to the next. They're constantly growing, learning, exploring new fields, carving new paths. They can't stand being where they've already been. They can't stand doing what they've already done.

They're always a bit clumsy, as whenever they perfect something, they move on. Their only constant skill is that of learning; their only constant trait is adaptability. Moving, moving, moving, often without ever looking back to realise the how much they've done for those whose paths they've crossed.

That's me.

I'm currently looking for new professional opportunities. 

Not those same good ol', stable jobs. I'm interested in your crazy projects. Your skunkworks division. Your exciting, new zero-g rocket-surgery malware-countermeasures gig.

Right now my main interest is in back-end, golang, and/or infrastructure-related work.

Oh, and I'm a textbook case for working remotely.

I can't wait to hear from you.
