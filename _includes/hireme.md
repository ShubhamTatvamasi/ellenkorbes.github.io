# Hire me

I'm currently looking for new professional opportunities.

I have a preference for back-end, golang, and/or infrastructure-related projects. But if your project is crazy enough disregard all of that and let me hear it anyway.

I'm a textbook case for working remotely. In my previous professional engagement I contracted full-time for a California-based company, and during the 2 years and 7 months of that experience I've proven to be everything they hoped for and then some.

In [their words](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ebb90ef17a1f61b6):

What motivates me the most in a project is learning new things and facing exciting challenges. If you're looking for someone who'll churn out the same rehashed product over and over, you're better off with someone else.
