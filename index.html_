<h2>Slightly overwhelmed?</h2>

<h4>February 17, 2017</h4>

<p>Howdy! The last time I was just starting to get a grip on Flexbox. Now I think I know just enough of it to be useful, and I‚Äôve used it to finish my portfolio page project on freeCodeCamp. You can see the end result <a href="https://codepen.io/ellenkorbes/full/vgremq/">here</a> (and just for kicks <a href="http://codepen.io/ellenkorbes/full/vgMgde/">here</a>‚Äôs the project I did before that).</p>

<p>It works alright, I guess, but there‚Äôs still too much of it that‚Äôs a mystery to me. I needed to ask for help to get the burger menu working‚Äîthe one that appears on small screens and hides the nav menu‚Äîand, frankly, I have no idea how the things I was told to do ended up producing the results I got.</p>

<p>I really feel I need to pour more time into this, and keep at it until I master it. Unknowns are unsettling‚Ä¶ But as you‚Äôll read later on in this post, time is against me.</p>

<p>For now, moving on with the freeCodeCamp curricula.</p>

<p>I have four projects to complete next. They are in the <em>Intermediate Front End Development Projects</em> section, which comes right after <em>JSON APIs and Ajax</em> and <em>Basic Algorithm Scripting</em>. Should be fun. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe">Build a Random Quote Machine</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV">Show the Local Weather</a></li>
<li><a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga">Build a Wikipedia Viewer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo">Use the Twitch.tv JSON API</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can click each of them to see what the end result should look like. Again, sounds like a fun time.</p>

        <p>There are two more things on my plate as well:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>One is to get this website to run on Jekyll. Right now it‚Äôs a simple html sheet, which we all know doesn‚Äôt scale. </li>
    
    <li>And two is, I‚Äôve volunteer to translate freeCodeCamp into Portuguese. The translation part should be fine, but the problem is that to do that I need to be somewhat proficient with Git, which right now I‚Äôm not. Gotta clone the repo onto my machine and so on. More reading.</li>
        </ul>

<p>Now, none of the projects sounds too complicated, and neither is getting Jekyll up and running or the translation thingy, but as someone who works full time and has a family and does the dishes and etc., finding the time is a bit difficult . It was frustrating this week that it took me so long learn Flexbox... it‚Äôs such a simple thing, but again, time. Time is my nemesis.</p>

<p>On top of that, the hell-on-Earth temperatures here in Brazil don‚Äôt help either. I wonder how many days in a row I can spend working under the mall‚Äôs A/C before they kick me out.</p>

<h2>Because there weren‚Äôt enough ‚Äúwatch me learn how to code‚Äù journals in the world.</h2>

<h4>February 15, 2017</h4>

<p>Hello there. As you can guess, this is me chronicling my hurdles and achievements‚Äîmostly hurdles‚Äîwhile learning the whole she-bang one needs to master to justify the title of full-stack developer.</p>

<p>I can‚Äôt remember how I started down this road, but anyway, this is me attempting to learn a new craft.</p>

<p>I had stumbled upon JavaScript a few times the past few months. You know, JavaScript, the toy scripting language from the early 2000‚Äôs? Except not anymore. It grew up. It‚Äôs a serious tool now. So I took a look around, signed up for a few edX courses I gave up after two days, and eventually came across <a href="www.freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a>.</p>

<p>Their learning sequence goes HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Sass, React, D3, Node.js, MongoDB, and then using it all in the real world by working on projects for nonprofit organizations. Which sounds great to me.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was sprint through their basic HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript exercises, and skipped the required projects at first. I thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just breezed through all these fancy JavaScript algorithms, I‚Äôll surely have no problem with some simple HTML and CSS.‚Äù My mistake.</p>

<p>I came back to the required projects, the first of which was to build a simple tribute page like <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW">this</a>, and the second a portfolio page like <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB">this</a>. Now if I were to write them from scratch, fine. But freeCodeCamp preaches Bootstrap, and Bootstrap‚Ä¶ I just could not wrap my head around it. Particularly the whole grid layout system kajigger. It didn‚Äôt help that the course taught Bootstrap 3 while I was trying to use Bootstrap 4. But seriously. Bootstrap. My nemesis.</p>

<p>I pounded my head against it and eventually gave up doing the exercise. I‚Äôd need to give Bootstrap some serious study to really grasp it. So there I was, yanking my hair out and chewing my nails, when I came across Flexbox.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve read that it can replace Bootstrap‚Äôs usual grid system, that it‚Äôs simpler, that it solves a bunch of Bootstrap problems I don‚Äôt really understand, and so on. I still don‚Äôt know whether that‚Äôs all true, but I‚Äôm giving Flexbox a go. Right now I‚Äôm following the <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af">Understanding Flexbox</a> guide, by Ohans Emmanuel. Thus far it makes sense to me, which is more than I could ever say about Bootstrap‚Äôs grid system.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll see how it goes. </p>

<p>Work in progress.</p>

<p>(And darn, I can‚Äôt wait to be done with this designerly stuff and get back to real code.)</p>
