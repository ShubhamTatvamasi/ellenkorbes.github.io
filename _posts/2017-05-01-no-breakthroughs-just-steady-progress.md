Whoa it’s been two months and some change since the last post here. You’d think I’d be hacking the gibson by now, eh? We’ll get to that.

First some updates regarding the post immediately before this one:

- I’m done with freeCodeCamp’s front-end certificate. It wasn’t too difficult, but I’m realizing more and more that my thing is actual code, not design. Which kinda intrigues me and makes want to learn design properly, but that’s definitely not where my talent lies.
- This website is now Jekyll-powered! No more typing up HTML by hand!
- The freeCodeCamp translations weren’t hard to get going. I’ll write up a guide soon, though, since it was definitely not straight forward. *Yay, [I’ve](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/13756) [helped](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/13422) a big open source project!*

So for the past couple months I’ve been following [this](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-get-job-ready-with-1-fcc-cert-3-projects-2-courses-and-10-books/64027?source_topic_id=67265) guide. The beginning of it, anyway. Meaning, reading the You Don’t Know JS series. I’m three books done outta six, so halfway through. 

It’s crazy interesting but I do miss working on projects hands-on. And the biggest problem is, reading theory is not something I get crazy excited to do first thing outta bed; not like practical stuff. That makes progress slower, which fucking sucks. But I also don’t want to skip it, so I guess that’s that for now.

I’ve also spent a significant amount of time setting up a coding environment here. Meaning emacs, todo lists, organizing things. And now I’m spending a good chunk of time re-writing all the code I wrote in freeCodeCamp, following JavaScript Standard Style this time, and getting rid of jQuery as much as possible.

Sounds like a huge waste of time to be doing that instead of moving forward, and it probably is to some extent. But I’m a believer that sticking to good practices since the very beginning tends to pay off in the long run.

This little adventure will also include typing up all the code I’m running across on the book series. One, so I can make better sense of it; two, so I have an organized catalog of it all that I’ll make use of during those “what was that thing I saw just the other day” moments.

After that I’ll move on to the back end part of freeCodeCamp. That’s nodejs, expressjs, and mongodb. Exciting stuff.

In unrelated news, a few days ago I came across a book called *How to Develop a Perfect Memory,* by Dominic O’Brien. He’s an eight times world memory champion or something, and the techniques seem very very useful. It’s hard stuff, definitely not some cheap and easy tricks, so they do take effort to learn. But if you know me you know just how bad my memory is, and how much of an annoyance my shitty memory is day-to-day. So let’s hope I can put that to use and make my life ever so slightly easier.

I’ve also recently made friends with the totally awesome [Kris Nova](https://twitter.com/Kris__Nova), whom I’ve been learning a lot from. I’ve joined a project of hers written totally in Go the other day, and while Go might be a bit of a detour from my web development path, it looks fun and I’m kinda curious to take my next day off and find out just how much of a totally new language I can learn in a single day.

And hopefully I won’t take two and a half months to post the next update here :)
