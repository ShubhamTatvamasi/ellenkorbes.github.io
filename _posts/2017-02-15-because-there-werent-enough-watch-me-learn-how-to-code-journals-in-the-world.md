Hello there. As you can guess, this is me chronicling my hurdles and achievements—mostly hurdles—while learning the whole she-bang one needs to master to justify the title of full-stack developer.

I can’t remember how I started down this road, but anyway, this is me attempting to learn a new craft.

I had stumbled upon JavaScript a few times the past few months. You know, JavaScript, the toy scripting language from the early 2000’s? Except not anymore. It grew up. It’s a serious tool now. So I took a look around, signed up for a few edX courses I gave up after two days, and eventually came across [freeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com).

Their learning sequence goes HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Sass, React, D3, Node.js, MongoDB, and then using it all in the real world by working on projects for nonprofit organizations. Which sounds great to me.

The first thing I did was sprint through their basic HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript exercises, and skipped the required projects at first. I thought, “I’ve just breezed through all these fancy JavaScript algorithms, I’ll surely have no problem with some simple HTML and CSS.” My mistake.

I came back to the required projects, the first of which was to build a simple tribute page like [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW), and the second a portfolio page like [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB). Now if I were to write them from scratch, fine. But freeCodeCamp preaches Bootstrap, and Bootstrap… I just could not wrap my head around it. Particularly the whole grid layout system kajigger. It didn’t help that the course taught Bootstrap 3 while I was trying to use Bootstrap 4\. But seriously. Bootstrap. My nemesis.

I pounded my head against it and eventually gave up doing the exercise. I’d need to give Bootstrap some serious study to really grasp it. So there I was, yanking my hair out and chewing my nails, when I came across Flexbox.

I’ve read that it can replace Bootstrap’s usual grid system, that it’s simpler, that it solves a bunch of Bootstrap problems I don’t really understand, and so on. I still don’t know whether that’s all true, but I’m giving Flexbox a go. Right now I’m following the [Understanding Flexbox](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af) guide, by Ohans Emmanuel. Thus far it makes sense to me, which is more than I could ever say about Bootstrap’s grid system.

We’ll see how it goes.

Work in progress.

(And darn, I can’t wait to be done with this designerly stuff and get back to real code.)
