Howdy! The last time I was just starting to get a grip on Flexbox. Now I think I know just enough of it to be useful, and I’ve used it to finish my portfolio page project on freeCodeCamp. You can see the end result [here](https://codepen.io/ellenkorbes/full/vgremq/) (and just for kicks [here](http://codepen.io/ellenkorbes/full/vgMgde/)’s the project I did before that).

It works alright, I guess, but there’s still too much of it that’s a mystery to me. I needed to ask for help to get the burger menu working—the one that appears on small screens and hides the nav menu—and, frankly, I have no idea how the things I was told to do ended up producing the results I got.

I really feel I need to pour more time into this, and keep at it until I master it. Unknowns are unsettling… But as you’ll read later on in this post, time is against me.

For now, moving on with the freeCodeCamp curricula.

I have four projects to complete next. They are in the _Intermediate Front End Development Projects_ section, which comes right after _JSON APIs and Ajax_ and _Basic Algorithm Scripting_. Should be fun. They are:

*   [Build a Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe)
*   [Show the Local Weather](http://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV)
*   [Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga)
*   [Use the Twitch.tv JSON API](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo)

You can click each of them to see what the end result should look like. Again, sounds like a fun time.

There are two more things on my plate as well:

*   One is to get this website to run on Jekyll. Right now it’s a simple html sheet, which we all know doesn’t scale.
*   And two is, I’ve volunteer to translate freeCodeCamp into Portuguese. The translation part should be fine, but the problem is that to do that I need to be somewhat proficient with Git, which right now I’m not. Gotta clone the repo onto my machine and so on. More reading.

Now, none of the projects sounds too complicated, and neither is getting Jekyll up and running or the translation thingy, but as someone who works full time and has a family and does the dishes and etc., finding the time is a bit difficult . It was frustrating this week that it took me so long learn Flexbox... it’s such a simple thing, but again, time. Time is my nemesis.

On top of that, the hell-on-Earth temperatures here in Brazil don’t help either. I wonder how many days in a row I can spend working under the mall’s A/C before they kick me out.
